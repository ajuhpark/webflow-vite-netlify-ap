# ViteJs + JS + Webflow = ❤️

This is a basic setup with [ViteJs](https://vitejs.dev/) that you can use for your Webflow website.
`jQuery` is already installed and declared as an external dependency.

I'm using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build and host my code because it's easy to use, free, and has serverless functions out of the box. Feel free to use your favorite CDN.

**If you prefer TypeScript you can use [this template](https://github.com/armandsalle/vite-typescript-webflow)**

<br />

## Live demo

You can find a simple example of a Webflow site using this setup [here](https://vite-javascript.webflow.io/). The code is hosted on Netlify [here](https://vite-javascript-webflow.netlify.app/main.js). If you want to see the Webflow preview, it's [here](https://preview.webflow.com/preview/vite-javascript?utm_medium=preview_link&utm_source=designer&utm_content=vite-javascript&preview=65fac120c82ee6a81780f5a5cd5ecc59&workflow=preview) 👍

## Building and running on localhost

This project is using `yarn`.

First, install dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

To launch a local dev server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

To create a production build:

```sh
yarn build
```

To clean the local `/dist` folder:

```sh
yarn clean
```

To lint the code with ESLint and Prettier:

```sh
yarn lint:fix
```

--

npx vite build to build.

do npm run dev to start server.

Tried building a library using this:
Use Vite for JavaScript Libraries

There's also a medium article on how to get multiple js working:

//addressing the Flash of unstyled content issue.
window.addEventListener("load", function(event) {

Previously I made a .npmrc file and put this in it

//npm.greensock.com/:_authToken=ce690915-b140-4149-88f6-3ce3e5a3d98c
@gsap:registry=https://npm.greensock.com/

But I don't need it anymore because i just used the actual file and put it in webflow.

--

test change before i delete yarn.lock.
--

maybe it was becauase i didn't merge the feature/gsap branch to the main. 

--

trying a diff version of yarn.

for some reason other case_study.js file didn't build. 1
